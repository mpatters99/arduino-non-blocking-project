# arduino-non-blocking-project
This project is for the Arduino forum. I was trying to learn about how to implement non blocking. This archive is really for my own records.

I used a step motor as well as the HC_SR04.
If you use any of this code, I suggest you compare it to code from other more experienced programmers as I am still learning. 

The source should be taken from click_me_first.zip.  I also added a terrible schematic (jpg) of the configuration for my own personal notes.
